Rapid            1-1 GAK
  (Wallner 62; Tutu 72)
  [protest Rapid as referee disallowed a 45' goal by Wallner (Rapid) after the 
   break, restarting the match with a referee's ball rather than the second half
   kick-off (officially the match was interrupted until the re-start rather than
   a break having been held); the GAK defenders had stopped playing before the 
   goal because of a whistle from the stands which they believed to come from 
   the referee (for off-side - which would probably have been the correct
   decision in any case); Rapid want a replay of the 2nd half starting at 1-0;
   then GAK have requested a replay (one assumes from scratch); after the result
   was already confirmed by 2 instances, Rapid withdrew the protest on May 22,
   by which time it had become pointless, as Tirol were mathematically champions
   irrespective of this result]
